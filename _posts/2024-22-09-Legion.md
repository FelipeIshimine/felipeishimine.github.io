# Description
Genre: Party-based roguelike RPG.

Legion, is a turn based roguelike RPG that draws inspiration from games like Hades, Vakyrie Profile, Darkest Dungeon and Pokemon. With a high emphasis on positioning, team sinergies,  elemental advantage systems and replayability. 


## Project Status

This project was a "Vertical Slice" we made with a team of 3 (Programmer, 2D Artist, Audio Designer/Musician), to be pitched during the EVA 2024 Business Round Up. 

Currently development is on hold for the time being, as it is a passion project with high complexity we cannot realistically go further with such a limited team and resources. 


## Dev time

From October 2023 to May 2024 on my spared time by myself.

From May 2024 to September 2025 i worked full time by myself, with help from Micaela Karaman doing Art and Bautista Krotter doing audio, both of them on their spare time.
