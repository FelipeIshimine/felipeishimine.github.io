# Description 
Guitar Hero style rythm game.
Includes unlockable songs, and customizable cats.

## My Roles
Programmer

### Development Challenges 
Made a level editor for fast creation of songs and a midi to level convertion algorithm to quickly test songs.
Cats have "modular" body parts, so they can be interchangeable allowing for highly customizable cats
